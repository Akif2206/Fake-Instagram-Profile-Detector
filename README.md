# Fake-Instagram-Profile-Detector
Fake Instagram Profile Detector
In this practical project, we will build and train a simple artificial neural network model to detect spam/fake Instagram accounts. Fake and spam accounts are a serious problem on social networks. Many people on social media use fake Instagram accounts to create the illusion of having a large number of followers. Fake accounts can be used to impersonate others or to sell fraudulent services/products. The data was sourced from Kaggle. In this practical project, we will complete the following steps:

Import the dataset and libraries
Perform exploratory data analysis
Visualize the data
Prepare the data for modeling
Build and train a simple deep learning model
Evaluate the trained model
